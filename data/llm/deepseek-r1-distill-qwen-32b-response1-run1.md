Okay, so I need to perform a thematic analysis on this text about people's experiences interacting with Artificial Social Agents. The research question is "How do people experience their interaction with Artificial Social Agents?" 

First, I'll start by familiarizing myself with the data. I'll read through all the provided text to get an overall sense of what people are saying. It seems like participants have used various AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Assistant, Alexa, Roomba, Bing, and Bard. They talk about how these agents help them with tasks, provide information, sometimes lack creativity or consistency, and their feelings towards the interactions.

Next, I'll move on to coding. I need to identify relevant codes from the text. Each code should be a short label (â‰¤3 words) that captures a key aspect of the experiences described. For example, when someone mentions how easy it is to use an AI tool, that could be a code like "Ease of Use." If they talk about feeling a connection or not, that might be "Emotional Connection."

After coding, I'll group these codes into themes. Themes should reflect broader categories that tie together related codes. For instance, codes like "Task Assistance," "Information Provision," and "Productivity Enhancement" could all fall under the theme of "Practical Functionality." Similarly, codes about how human-like or trustworthy the AI seems might form a theme around "Perceived Humanity."

I need to make sure each step is thorough. In familiarization, I should note recurring ideas like reliability issues, emotional responses, and the balance between helpfulness and limitations. For coding, I'll go through each participant's comments and extract the main points, ensuring that each code accurately represents a significant aspect of their experience.

When grouping codes into themes, I'll look for conceptual similarities. If multiple codes deal with how users feel about the AI (e.g., "Emotional Connection," "Trust"), they can form a theme like "User Perception." Similarly, codes related to how well the AI performs tasks and provides information can be grouped under "Functionality."

I should also consider any contradictions or variations in experiences. For example, some users find interactions with AI very helpful, while others feel disconnected or skeptical about its reliability.

Finally, I'll present my findings clearly, summarizing each theme and explaining how they relate to the research question. This will help answer how people experience their interactions with these agents by highlighting key aspects like functionality, emotional engagement, perceived humanity, practical benefits, limitations, and future potential.

### Thematic Analysis: How People Experience Interactions with Artificial Social Agents

#### **Step 1: Familiarization**

The text explores various experiences of interacting with Artificial Social Agents (ASAs) such as ChatGPT, Google Assistant, Alexa, Roomba, Bing, and Bard. Participants highlight the agents' practicality in task assistance, information provision, and productivity enhancement. However, they also note limitations like lack of creativity, inconsistency, and reliability issues. Emotional responses vary from feelings of connection to detachment, with some users appreciating the agents' efficiency while others express skepticism about their humanity or trustworthiness.

#### **Step 2: Coding**

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Task Assistance | Use of ASAs for completing daily tasks and chores. |
| Information Provision | ASAs providing answers, explanations, and guidance on various topics. |
| Emotional Connection | Feelings of connection or lack thereof with the ASA. |
| Perceived Humanity | Users' perception of whether the ASA seems human-like. |
| Trustworthiness | Belief in the reliability and accuracy of the ASA's responses. |
| Creativity Limitations | ASAs struggling to generate creative or nuanced content. |
| Productivity Enhancement | Improvement in efficiency and task completion through ASA use. |
| User Satisfaction | Overall positive experiences with ASAs. |
| Technical Issues | Problems like voice recognition errors or inconsistent performance. |
| Future Potential | Belief in the growth and development of ASA technology. |

#### **Step 3: Grouping**

| Group # | Theme | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Practical Functionality | ASAs are valued for their ability to assist with tasks, provide information, and enhance productivity. |
| 2 | Emotional Engagement | Users experience a range of emotions from connection to detachment when interacting with ASAs. |
| 3 | Perceived Humanity | The extent to which users perceive ASAs as human-like or emotionally intelligent. |
| 4 | Trust and Reliability | Users' trust in the ASA's accuracy and reliability, despite occasional issues. |
| 5 | Limitations and Challenges | Recognized shortcomings of ASAs, including creativity limitations and technical problems. |
| 6 | Future Outlook | Optimism about the potential growth and improvements in ASA technology. |

### **Summary**

The thematic analysis reveals that interactions with Artificial Social Agents are multifaceted, encompassing practical benefits, emotional responses, perceptions of humanity, trust issues, recognized limitations, and future expectations. These themes collectively address how people experience their interactions with ASAs, highlighting both the utility and the evolving nature of these technologies in daily life.
